# Version control basics - introduction to GitHub
The use of version control is a very useful skill for any programmer, especially when working in long projects with multiple people involved. This lecture will introduce the basics of version control, specifically the Git version control system and the collaboration platform GitHub.
Git allows you to keep track of multiple versions of files, track bugs to previous working versions, as well as collaborating with other developers on a project.
GitHub is a Web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all the functionality of Git and adds its own features, such as providing a graphical interface.
